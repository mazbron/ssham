/**
 * Class Permission
 *
 * The Permission model has the same three attributes as the Role:
 *   - name — Unique name for the permission, used for looking up permission information in the application layer. For
 *   example: "create-post", "edit-user", "post-payment", "mailing-list-subscribe".
 *   - display_name — Human readable name for the permission. Not necessarily unique and optional. For example "Create
 *   Posts", "Edit Users", "Post Payments",  "Subscribe to mailing list".
 *   - description — A more detailed explanation of the Permission. In general, it may be helpful to think of the last
 *   two attributes in the form of a sentence: "The permission display_name allows a user to description."
